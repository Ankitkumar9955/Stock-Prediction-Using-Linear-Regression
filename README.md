# 📈 Stock Market Prediction using Linear Regression

Predict stock prices using a simple yet effective **Linear Regression** model. This project leverages historical data to forecast future trends—providing valuable insights for educational and investment analysis purposes.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project utilizes **linear regression**, a core machine learning technique, to analyze and predict stock market prices. With the help of historical data from Yahoo Finance, the model makes predictions on stock prices and evaluates its performance using standard metrics.

---

## ✨ Features

* 📊 **Data Collection**: Pulls historical stock data using `yfinance` or similar APIs
* 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and formats the data for analysis
* 🤖 **Linear Regression Model**: Trains a regression model on stock trends
* 📉 **Visualization**: Compares actual vs predicted stock prices with interactive graphs
* 📈 **Performance Metrics**: Measures accuracy using **MSE** and **R² score**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Requirements

> **Language**: Python 3.7+

**Libraries Used:**

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`
* `matplotlib`
* `yfinance`
* *(Optional)* `pandas-datareader`

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-prediction-linear-regression.git
cd stock-prediction-linear-regression

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
python stock_predictor.py
```

Then follow the prompts to:

* 🔎 Enter a stock ticker (e.g., `AAPL`, `MSFT`, `INFY.NS`)
* 📅 Select a date range for training data
* ⏳ Choose a prediction period

**Output Includes:**

* 📈 Console predictions
* 🖼️ Graphs showing actual vs predicted prices
* 📊 Model performance metrics

## ⚠️ Limitations

* 📉 Linear regression may oversimplify real-world stock market behavior
* 📆 Predictions are **historical-trend-based**—they don’t account for external economic events
* 🚫 Not recommended for real-time or high-frequency trading

---

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

* 📚 Add multiple ML models (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM) for comparison
* 📈 Include technical indicators (MACD, RSI) as additional features
* 📰 Integrate sentiment analysis from financial news
* 🌐 Develop a user-friendly **web interface**
