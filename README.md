# Stock Market Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict stock market prices using linear regression, a fundamental machine learning technique. The application analyzes historical stock data to forecast future prices, providing insights for potential investment decisions.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance or other financial APIs
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares data for analysis
- **Linear Regression Model**: Implements a simple yet effective prediction model
- **Visualization**: Generates charts comparing actual vs predicted prices
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates model accuracy using metrics like MSE and R² score

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - yfinance (for Yahoo Finance data)
  - (Optional) pandas-datareader

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-prediction-linear-regression.git
   cd stock-prediction-linear-regression
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
   ```
   python stock_predictor.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to:
   - Enter a stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT)
   - Select a date range for training data
   - Choose prediction timeframe

3. View the results:
   - Prediction output in the console
   - Visualization of actual vs predicted prices
   - Model performance metrics

## Limitations

- Linear regression is a simple model that may not capture complex market dynamics
- Predictions are based on historical data and don't account for unexpected market events
- Not suitable for high-frequency trading or short-term predictions

## Future Enhancements

- Implement multiple regression models for comparison
- Add technical indicators as features
- Incorporate sentiment analysis from news sources
- Develop a web interface for easier interaction
